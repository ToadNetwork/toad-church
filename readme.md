## About this repository

This is the **Toad.Network Church** repository

Contains the code related to the toadnetwork church webpage, which allows you to interact with the church contract to both make TOAD donations to the church AND praise to the Toad to diseminate some Toad tokens among several lucky BSC holders.

When donating  (via the "Offerings" link and input control), an approval for the amount stated on the input control will be requested to your ERC20 wallet (hence it has to be connected to the site) and delivered to the church contract so that it is used on future praises.

When praising, a small amount of TOAD is sprad between several random BSC Wallets.

TOAD BSC contract can be checked at The DOCS [here](https://docs.toad.network/reference/contract-addresses#usdtoad-contracts).
